build this shit:-dukaan/[differntUserName] as they sign 


We defined this as Dukaan's Core Loop:

Create a Store: A single page where a user enters their phone number, receives an OTP (One-Time Password) to verify it, and gives their store a name. That's it. Their store is live. No email, no password, no complex forms.
Add Products: The simplest possible product form. A field for the product name, a field for the price, and a button to upload a single image from their phone's gallery. No categories, no variants (like size or color), no inventory count. Just the basics to create a catalog.
Share a Link: Once they added a few products, the app would generate a unique, shareable link like mydukaan.io/mystore. They could copy this link and paste it directly into their WhatsApp chats.
